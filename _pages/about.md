My name is Jiyoung Park. I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at Texas A&M University, advised by [Anirban Bhattacharya](https://sites.google.com/view/anirban-bhattacharya-tamu/). Concurrently, I am pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Mathematics under the guidance of [Jonathan W. Siegel](https://jwsiegel2510.github.io/), in collaboration with [Stephan Wojtowytsch](https://www.swojtowytsch.com/). My current research interests include (but are not limited to) statistical learning theory, approximation theory, optimization theory, and optimal transport.

I completed my undergraduate studies at Seoul National University, where I double majored in Economics and Statistics, with a minor in Computer Science and Engineering. After graduation and prior to beginning my Ph.D., I worked as a Research Resident at [KC-ML2](https://www.kc-ml2.com/), conducting research on graph neural networks and reinforcement learning under the supervision of [Chan Y. Park](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chan-youn-park/).

**I am on the postdoc job market in fall 2025.** Please feel free to reach out if you know of any opportunities.
